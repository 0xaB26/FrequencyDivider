#### Frequency Divider With verilog : 
The verilog code is for designing a frequency divider that outputs three different clocks with(50 Khz, 100 Khz and 250 Khz).
* CLOCK 1 : 250 Khz
* CLOCK 2 : 100 Khz
* CLOCK 3 : 50 Khz

the verilog code was tested in ModelSim using ModelSim simulator, you can check the simulation by reviewing the [@simulation](https://github.com/0xaB26/FrequencyDivider/blob/main/wave)
